                <h4>After a Swim by Idries Shah</h4>
                <img src="image/1after.jpg" width="200px">
                <p>
                    We are all limited by our habits. In this story, a cat and horse make a deal to cross a river
                    together to enjoy juicy corn in a field on the other side. But the cat’s idiotic habits cause
                    trouble and the horse must not only get them to safety but teach the cat a lesson.

                    After a Swim teaches children that if they are captive to their poor behaviour and make excuses for
                    themselves, no amount of ambition, innovation or motivation will lead to success. The cat learns
                    that lesson to its surprise and detriment, in this funny, memorable tale.

                <p>
                    Stubbornness is a human quality that can both serve and undermine. In this story, a newly married
                    couple, glowing from their lavish nuptials, nonetheless fall victim to their own stubbornness. So
                    determined are they not to give in, that they manage to lose everything, including one another.

                    Daby Zainab Faidhi’s insightful, playful illustrations bring this teaching story to life. With each
                    passing page, the reader witnesses the complete obliteration of a happy union as both bride and
                    groom become fixated on a meaningless competition. The ending is surprising, with a lesson that will
                    stay with the reader long after the book is closed.

                <p>
                    An exquisite satire on human scientific endeavour, The Ants and the Pen uses the intrepid but
                    ultimately tunnel-visioned ant to illustrate that information is not equal to knowledge.

                    Adventurous ants discover the enigmatic and exquisite squiggles of a pen. Emboldened, they push on
                    to discover the fingers, hand, arms and legs pushing the pen. But what use is all of this feverish
                    discovery if they miss the entire point of the pen and its squiggles?

                <p>
                    An extremely useful tale of how human emotions are infectious, not just the positive ones. Just as
                    negative thoughts can cascade, so in this book, the Horrible Dib Dib chains many characters in its
                    deathly grip.

                    A thief attempting to rob an old woman hears her muttering about the Horrible Dib Dib. ‘This
                    abominable Dib Dib will be the death of me,’ she cries. Gripped with paranoia, the thief slinks home
                    in chills, setting off a chain of events that ultimately reveals what exactly this horrible,
                    abominable Dib Dib is, that is worrying the life out of so many people. A wonderful tale that
                    reminds the reader how powerful human thoughts can be, even when they’re misguided.

                <p>

                    In this richly illustrated book, a town full of people who have never before seen an onion, try to
                    sum up the mysterious vegetable’s essence. But each person approaching the onion jumps immediately
                    and inevitably to the wrong conclusion.

                    The Onion illustrates how people have a tendency to judge based on random coincidences and rash
                    judgement. It is only when humans approach something with open-minded experimentation that sound and
                    useful conclusions can be reached.

                    This whimsical story, featuring fabulously detailed spreads, transmits a vital message in a way that
                    adults and children alike will appreciate.

                <p>
                    We all fear change and yet change is the very essence of life. How does a stream cross the mighty,
                    desolate desert? Can it allow itself to change its very form to survive the journey? The Tale of the
                    Sands helps the reader absorb the lesson that change can transform us, if only we have the courage
                    to embrace it.

                    The only characters in this book are a beautiful, flowing stream, a mighty, dry desert, the wind and
                    the voice of faith that lives within us all. As the stream confronts its many fears of being
                    subsumed by the wind, the voice reminds us that change allows us to grow, move and prosper.

                    Illustrated by Tanja Stevanovic

                    A wealthy merchant’s prize possession is a beautiful bird. Believing that he loves the exotic
                    creature too much to set it free, the merchant discovers that animals are sometimes better at
                    learning by example than humans. One thing children can learn from this story is that it is good to
                    observe others in order to learn and that sometimes the actions of others are not all that they
                    first seem to be.

                    A good-natured lion sees his reflection in a pool and gasps at the fierce creature staring back at
                    him and is too frightened to drink. Children will learn through the lion how to deal positively with
                    fears and inhibitions that so often arise from situations they as yet may not understand.
                    Idries Shah’s collections of Eastern oral and written literature have established the Sufi
                    teaching-story as an educational instrument. The original version of this story was told by the
                    13th-century Sufi poet Jalaluddin Rumi.
                    Ingrid Rodriguez has illustrated this tale, bringing the animals to life with warmth and humor. Her
                    illustrations are full of incidental and small details that make her style distinctive.

                    A delightful and humorous tale about a chicken who learns to speak as we do. What follows will
                    intrigue young children and, at the same time, alert them in a very amusing way to the dangers of
                    being too gullible. This is illustrator/animator Jeff Jackson’s first children’s book. It expresses
                    his unique ability to create a lively and amusing world, rich in color and in which anything can
                    happen.

                    than enhancing them.
                    Among other things, this simple story shows children how a blind impulse to ‘win’ without
                    considering the consequences can end in the opposite effect.

                <p> Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the
                    hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”

                    When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when
                    they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.

                    “Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers, “when there is no wolf!” They angrily went back down
                    the hill.

                    Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his
                    amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.

                    As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really
                    is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they
                    walked grumbling down the hill once more.

                    For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to
                    prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.

                    Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item
                    into pure gold.

                    But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had
                    turned to gold in his hand.

                    Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the top of the wall, he saw
                    the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they
                    were ready to be eaten.

                    To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch
                    the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed yet again.

                    Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus on his looks, all while the cactus
                    remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed
                    by her own looks.

                    One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose
                    quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.

                    bring the milk to the market to sell. Molly loved to think about what to spend her money on.

                    As she filled the pails with milk and went to market, she again thought of all the things she wanted
                    to buy. As she walked along the road, she thought of buying a cake and a basket full of fresh
                    strawberries.

                    A little further down the road, she spotted a chicken. She thought, “With the money I get from
                    today, I’m going to buy a chicken of my own. That chicken will lay eggs, then I will be able to sell
                    milk and eggs and get more money!”

                    She continued, “With more money, I will be able to buy a fancy dress and make all the other
                    milkmaids jealous.” Out of excitement, Molly started skipping, forgetting about the milk in her
                    pails. Soon, the milk started spilling over the edges, covering Molly.

                <h4> The Golden Egg</h4>
                <img src="image/17egg.jpg" width="200px">
                <p> Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid one golden egg every day. The egg provided enough
                    money for the farmer and his wife to support their daily needs. The farmer and his wife continued to
                    be happy for a long time.

                    But, one day, the farmer thought to himself, “Why should we take just one egg a day? Why can’t we
                    take them all at once and make a lot of money?” The farmer told his wife his idea, and she foolishly
                    agreed.

                    Then, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a sharp knife. He
                    killed the goose and cut its stomach open, in the hopes of finding all its golden eggs. But, as he
                    opened the stomach, the only thing he found was guts and blood.

                <img src="image/18farmar.jpg" width="200px">
                <p> One day, a farmer was looking for a water source for his farm, when he bought a well from his
                    neighbor. The neighbor, however, was cunning. The next day, as the farmer came to draw water from
                    his well, the neighbor refused to let him take any water.

                    When the farmer asked why, the neighbor replied, “I sold you the well, not the water,” and walked
                    away. Distraught, the farmer went to the emperor to ask for justice. He explained what had happened.

                    The emperor called on Birbal, one of his nine, and wisest, courtiers. Birbal proceeded to question
                    the neighbor, “Why don’t you let the farmer take water from the well? You did sell the well to the
                    farmer?”

                <h4>Elephant and Friends</h4>
                <img src="image/19friend.jpg" width="200px">
                <p> A lone elephant walked through the forest, looking for friends. She soon saw a monkey and proceeded
                    to ask, ‘Can we be friends, monkey?’

                    The monkey quickly replied, ‘You are big and can’t swing on trees like I do, so I cannot be your
                    friend.’

                    Defeated, the elephant continued to search when it stumbled across a rabbit. She proceeded to ask
                    him, ‘Can we be friends, rabbit?’

                    The rabbit looked at the elephant and replied, “You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot
                    be my friend.”

                    Then, the elephant continued until she met a frog. She asked, “Will you be my friend, frog?”

                    The frog replied, “You are too big and heavy; you cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you can’t be
                    my friend.”

                <p>
                    Once, there were two brothers who lived at the forest’s edge. The oldest brother was always unkind
                    to his younger brother. The older brother took all the food and snatched all the good clothes.

                    The oldest brother used to go into the forest in search of firewood to sell in the market. As he
                    walked through the forest, he chopped off the branches of every tree, until he came upon a magical
                    tree.

                    The tree stopped him before he chopped its branches and said, ‘Oh, kind sir, please spare my
                    branches. If you spare me, I will provide you with golden apples.’

                    The oldest brother agreed but was feeling disappointed with how many apples the tree gave him.

                    Overcome by greed, the brother threatened to cut the entire tree if it didn’t provide him with more
                    apples. But, instead of giving more apples, the tree showered him with hundreds of tiny needles. The
                    brother fell to the ground, crying in pain as the sun began to set.
