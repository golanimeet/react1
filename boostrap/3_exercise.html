                    do it, but they will need to be more consistent.

                    Pardeep Narwal: Narwal is one of the greatest raiders in kabaddi history. He has won the PKL Most
                    Valuable Player award twice, and he is the all-time leading scorer in the league.

                <p>
                    The Tamil Thalaivas are a professional kabaddi team based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, that plays in the
                    Pro Kabaddi League (PKL). The team was founded in 2017 and is owned by Magnum Sports Private
                    Limited, the parent company of Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters FC. The team's home ground
                    is the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai.

                    The Tamil Thalaivas have not had much success in the PKL. They have never made the playoffs,
                    finishing last in Zone B in both their debut season (2017) and their second season (2018-19). In the
                    2019 season, they finished in 12th place, and in the 2021-22 season, they finished in 11th place.

                    The team's best player has been Ajay Thakur, who was the captain of the Indian national team from
                    2017 to 2021. Thakur was the team's leading raider in their debut season, scoring 204 raid points.
                    He has also been the team's captain since their inception.

                    In the 2023 season, the Tamil Thalaivas have made a number of changes in an attempt to improve their
                    performance. They have appointed Ashan Kumar as their head coach, and they have signed a number of
                    new players, including Pawan Sehrawat, the most expensive player in PKL history.

                    It remains to be seen whether the Tamil Thalaivas will be able to break their playoff duck in the
                    2023 season. However, they have made a number of positive changes, and they will be hoping that
                    these changes will lead to a more successful campaign.

                    The Telugu Titans are a team with a lot of potential. They have a strong squad and a good coach. If
                    they can continue to play their attacking style of play, they will be a force to be reckoned with in
                    the Pro Kabaddi League.
